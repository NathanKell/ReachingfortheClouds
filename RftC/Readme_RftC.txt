Instructions:
Extract RftC folder inside archive to GameData

Requirements:
Firespitter is required for texture-switching. TweakScale is highly recommended; parts will not function as designed without it. See above for which mods' parts are rescaled etc. You will need the mod if you want the RftC version(s) of the part(s).
Best with Realism Overhaul.

Description:
As Reaching for the Stars became increasingly plane-focused, I decided to release a separate pack without alternate-history parts. This pack includes different-colored textures for Procedural Wings and RealChute, black textures for most C7 parts and a TiberDyne nosecone, new rescaled copies of parts from Firespitter, Taverio's Pizza and Aerospace, a proc part that will count as shielding for FAR, Tweakscale tweaks, some rescales of the NP2 sharp nosecone, a smaller antenna, and two new cockpits. The first is Mettwurst's Mettworks inline cockpit, modeled on that of the F-104; the second is my repaint of an AIES nosecone, modeled on the M.52 cockpit.

Includes Mettworks Inline Cockpit by Mettwurst, retextured. Used with permission.
Includes cfg rescales/clone parts or derivative textures from the following mods (used with permission/within license). All assets are under their respective licenses.
AIES by the commendable carmics

Procedural Wings by the delightful DYJ
SXT by the laudable Lack
Taverio's Pizza and Aerospace is again by the terrific Taverius.
